##Versioning
Make some changes to your code and commit them with git commit.
Run npm version patch (or minor or major, depending on the change) to bump the version in package.json. This will also create a new commit and tag.
Push the commit and tag to GitHub with git push --follow-tags.
The GitHub Actions workflow will then trigger on this push, and it will publish your new version to npm.
This way, you're doing the version bump locally, but the publishing is automated with GitHub Actions.
